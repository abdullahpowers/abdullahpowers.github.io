<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally advise disposing of certain kinds of surfaces and objects. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical items in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup process, which likewise consists of sweeping and vacuuming up any dirt or small particles overlooked in the remediation process. A special HEPA vacuum guarantees that even tiny particles get collected to lessen the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make twice as sure that mold doesn't find a way out of the included work area and into a various part of the building.</p>
