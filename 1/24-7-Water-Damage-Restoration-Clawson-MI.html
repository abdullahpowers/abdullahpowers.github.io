<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
