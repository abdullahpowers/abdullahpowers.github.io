<p>Light flooding normally simply needs assistance in drying the area out, as well as basic cleanup services. These cases need very little time, and are simple to bring back as much as their complete capacity. However, once the standing water has actually permeated at least a foot past the walls, chances exist will be extensive repair work required. And if a tough surface area, such as stone, hardwood, or perhaps brick, becomes saturated, you require a true professional in your corner.</p>

There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>
