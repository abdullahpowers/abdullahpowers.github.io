<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most efficient. It is essential to identify if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly predicts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to several structure products and how they react to each one and provide the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the quicker products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
