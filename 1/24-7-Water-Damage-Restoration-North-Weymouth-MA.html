<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in North Weymouth</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
