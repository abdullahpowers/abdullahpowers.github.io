If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid type. The greater the dew point rises, the greater the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake.

These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days.
