<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Elkins</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and should be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying.
