By lowering the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
