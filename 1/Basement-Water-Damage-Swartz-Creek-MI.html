Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
