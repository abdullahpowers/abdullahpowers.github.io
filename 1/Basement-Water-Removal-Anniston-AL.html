<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
