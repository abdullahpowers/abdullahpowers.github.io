<p>Last but not least, we want to address making use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold growth is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities especially if used in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at eliminating mold than a mild detergent and a damp fabric, so we advise the least toxic choice.</p>
<p>Current Evaluation: A pipe burst in my crawlspace, triggering major water build-up. Colby and Caleb got here on the scene within a number of hours and proceeded to drain pipes the area before any damage was done to my home.

<p>Remediation experts must divulge, in writing, when and how they are deviating from the ANSI standard.
