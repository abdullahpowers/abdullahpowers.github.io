Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
