<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air.
