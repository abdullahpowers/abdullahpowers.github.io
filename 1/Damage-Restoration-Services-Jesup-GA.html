<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. Now that you can determine when water damage is covered by your property owner's insurance, it's crucial that you to contact your insurance provider as soon as possible once you find water damage in your house. You should take pictures of the afflicted location and whatever that was damaged, along with where the water came from, such as the burst pipe or Leaking roofing system and home insurance.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
