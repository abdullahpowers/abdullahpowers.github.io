<p>When you've found the offending growth, work up a mold-fighting solution. While a lot of agents can battle mold (Borax, bleach, ammonia, and vinegar, among others), tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract are frequently considered the most effective products to deodorize the issue and sanitize location. Moreover, they're totally non-toxic. You can purchase tea tree oil online and in health stores; just make sure that its from melaleuca alternifolia (an Australian tree) and that its active ingredients consist of 30 percent terpinen 4-ol and no greater than 10 to 15 percent cineole. Grapefruit seed extract may be somewhat less efficient but easier to discover, also readily available from these sorts of retailers.<p>
