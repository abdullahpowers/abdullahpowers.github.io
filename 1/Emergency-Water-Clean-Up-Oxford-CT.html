When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job effectively.
