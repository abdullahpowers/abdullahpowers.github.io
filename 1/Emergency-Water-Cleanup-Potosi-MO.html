<p>For this reason, we created a four-step technique that enables us to clean the afflicted location without jeopardizing the rest of your home. We can help bring back the environment in your house and provide irreversible treatments that keep mold growth at bay. Set an old box fan or an inexpensive new one in a window to aerate the room while working. Toss it out when you're done cleaning, since the spores are practically impossible to wipe. Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>
<p>Our local Doral location SERVPRO has the training and expertise to offer solutions for your residential or business residential or commercial property damage cleanup, restoration or repair requirements. Our SERVPRO experts can bring back and repair your residential or commercial property following a water fire, damage and smoke damage, mold damage, or flood and storm damage event. As soon as your surface area is dry and strong, apply a filler to make the surface area smooth and prepared for painting. Generally, you must offer this action at least a complete day of drying time. We kind of cheated in the video above by using a hair clothes dryer to accelerate the process, but best practice here is one-day drying time.<p>
