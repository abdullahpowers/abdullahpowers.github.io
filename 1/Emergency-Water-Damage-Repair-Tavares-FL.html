<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected stretching rural homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics constructed with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local firms. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we first look for any security threats, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for confined space entry. We then draw out standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has actually been affected, we will remove the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely dispose of it. If they have been damaged, we will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finishing that prevents water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them.</p>

Cleaning the noticeable side of a wall surface might not deliver true mold removal.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we want to attend to making use of bleach on mold.

First, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical level of sensitivities particularly if used in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at eliminating mold than a wet cloth and a mild detergent, so we recommend the least harmful option.</p>
