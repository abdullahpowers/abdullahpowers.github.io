<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As discussed, fast air motion across damp surface areas of assemblies or products is a vital element of efficiently and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or products.

For these reasons attempt to avoid using bleach and if you need to use it, just use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
