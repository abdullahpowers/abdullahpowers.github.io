Once this combustible fuel - furniture, carpet, or drywall - has actually been heated to its distinct ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and volatile gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause lasting damage and should be dealt with by knowledgeable professionals, heat is the most obvious, and destructive, item of this chain reaction.
