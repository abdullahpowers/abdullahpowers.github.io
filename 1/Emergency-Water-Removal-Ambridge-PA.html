<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Ambridge</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repair work, remember that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
