<p>These aspects affect the motion of wetness within a material along with the evaporation rate from the surface area of the product and can significantly impact the general drying. time for a job. It is important to rapidly control the wetness in the air and use sufficient air flow to dry the surface area of products to lower water activity, therefore decreasing the capacity for microbial growth. If the surface areas of hygroscopic products can be dried and maintained below 0.75, microbial growth can be quickly stopped, although the core of the product may still have raised moisture material.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications.</p>
