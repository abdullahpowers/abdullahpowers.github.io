Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment.
