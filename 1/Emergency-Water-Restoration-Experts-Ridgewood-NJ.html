<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (often two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
