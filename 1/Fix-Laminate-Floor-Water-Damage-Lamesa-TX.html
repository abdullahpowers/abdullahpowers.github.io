<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>As a naturally occurring and pervasive substance in our world, mold exists in a range of different kinds-- much of which are non-toxic and primarily affect those with allergies and asthma. Black mold, particularly, though, is a more major transgressor. Exposure to the poisonous range of Stachybotrys chartarum can trigger breathing concerns varying from mild to serious. It, like many kinds of mold, grows at a worrying rate in the best conditions-- namely in locations with extended direct exposure to moisture and humidity, such as basements, bathrooms, under-sink cabinets, or just recently flooded locations. For this reason, house owners should act in the beginning indication of it, and discover how to remove black mold prior to it changes from a benign player to an intrusive species.</p>
