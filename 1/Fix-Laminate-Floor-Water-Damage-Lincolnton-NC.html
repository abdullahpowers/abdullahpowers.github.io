<p>Mold and mildew are kinds of fungis that rapidly reach critical mass anywhere wetness is present indoors. This can arise from any number of situations such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a damaged pipe, or even a malfunctioning A/C system - all of which can lead to trouble. Any high degree of wetness, integrated with temperature level and nutrients, develops the best environment for the fungal parts of mold and mildew to flourish. It is necessary to remove the source of the wetness to avoid the spread of mold contamination as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you pick to work with a specialist (or other expert company) to do the cleanup, ensure the contractor has experience cleaning up mold. Inspect references and ask the specialist to follow the recommendations in EPA's" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings, the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the Standards of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMM), the industry requirements released by the Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC) or other appropriate guidelines from industry, professional or government companies.</p>

Extreme rain can over saturate the ground, resulting in leakages, frozen pipe water damage, and even fractures throughout the basement.

There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, however the most typical types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore arrive at a food source that is warm and damp, it begins to germinate and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or toxic gasses are launched as the fungi spreads. Mold in your house can be very hazardous and cause a range of health problems. If the mold in your house is not removed effectively it can continue to grow, making effective mold remediation more challenging and costly.<p>
