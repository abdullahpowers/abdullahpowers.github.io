<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, mainly triggering breathing concerns. However in severe cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia. When you suspect a mold intrusion, you may wish to buy a mold testing package to see what kind of mold spores you're working with, and call in a professional to aid with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you most likely already have on-hand) that will help get rid of mold.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum: this mold is typically described as black mold or toxic mold due to the fact that of the mycotoxins that it can produce. This mold can be harmful to your health in the form of chronic sinus infections, asthma, and tiredness. It grows in areas that stay continuously wet, like cooling systems. In addition to being damaging, black mold can also stain surfaces it grows on, which can make it more difficult to effectively eliminate. Typically, surface areas with black mold may require extra whitening or replacement to deal with the stains. In some cases, an encapsulating representative might be required to cover the stain and any staying spores.</p>
