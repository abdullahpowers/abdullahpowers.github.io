The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is ended up.<p>
