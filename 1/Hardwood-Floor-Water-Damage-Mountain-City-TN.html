<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Mountain City</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists normally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water easily.
