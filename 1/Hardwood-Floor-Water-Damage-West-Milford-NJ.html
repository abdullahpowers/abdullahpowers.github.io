<p>The biggest component that can be gotten rid of is the wetness that mold needs to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, but the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is wet and warm, it begins to sprout and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to turn into the food source and mycotoxins or poisonous gasses are released as the fungis spreads. Mold in your home can be extremely unsafe and result in a range of health concerns. Making reliable mold remediation more hard and costly if the mold in your home is not removed effectively it can continue to grow.<p>
