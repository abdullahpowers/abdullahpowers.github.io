<h2>Conquering Mold From Water Damage in Morgantown</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Any structure that has actually suffered from water damage or issues with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floorings and walls is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering might require replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Moldy smells can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have taken place and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
