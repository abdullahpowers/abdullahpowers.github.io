Whether it's a dripping roofing system, a broken pipeline or leaking toilet, it can sometimes be difficult to locate the source. Water can take a trip far from the leak and trigger damage somewhere you would not expect it. This implies you need to do some exploration and investigation. Eliminate damaged drywall so that you can much better see where the leakage is coming from (see Step 2) and so you can dry the water-damaged area.</p>

<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Wauconda</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health hazard and ought to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>After the flood waters decline and the tidy up has been done, most folks want to get back into their houses or organisations and start reconstructing. The problem is that wood that has been immersed in water has likely soaked up a big quantity of water. Restoring too rapidly after a flood can trigger continuing issues such as mold growth, insect infestations, and degeneration of the wood and wall coverings.<p>
