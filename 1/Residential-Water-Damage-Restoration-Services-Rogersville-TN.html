<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
