If they have been damaged, we will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them.</p>

<p>More involved testing may involve sending out samples to a screening center, or taking samples of the air to test if there is no noticeable mold, but mold is thought. Checking for mold might cost just $20 for a home package or as much as $500 for professional screening.
