<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
