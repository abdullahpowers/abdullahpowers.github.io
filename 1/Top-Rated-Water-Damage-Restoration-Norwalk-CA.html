<p>Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and must be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, duct work and circuitry.</p>
<p>Under the law, it is your right to determine what company will perform work in your home or business.
