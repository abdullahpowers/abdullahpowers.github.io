<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is one of the most terrible things that can occur to a household or a person. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being fully replaced.

However, if the damage is major then the entire floor may require changing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The sort of wood flooring you may have limits the type and identifies of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood flooring permits a broader range of alternatives to repair the issue. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface.
