<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
