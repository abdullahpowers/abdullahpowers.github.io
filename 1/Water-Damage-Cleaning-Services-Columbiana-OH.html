That's all part of the cleanup process, which also includes vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or small particles ignored in the remediation procedure. A special HEPA vacuum makes sure that even small particles get collected to reduce the chances of the mold moving in other places. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make twice as sure that mold does not find an escape of the included work area and into a various part of the structure.</p>
