And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be.

<p>Rust is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish deterioration of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration happens when you combine electrical energy, water, oxygen and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically known as rust). There is no dependable schedule for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal components normally start rusting right away after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How fast the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
