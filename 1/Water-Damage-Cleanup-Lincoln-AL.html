<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>The inspectors at Mold Solutions NW know how to find any and all mold that may remain in a building. We wish to root it out wherever it lives so it can not harm people or property. The evaluations we carry out are therefore extremely in-depth. We understand the Pacific Northwest and Seattle; we know the environment here can promote mold development due to the damp weather condition.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which means that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
