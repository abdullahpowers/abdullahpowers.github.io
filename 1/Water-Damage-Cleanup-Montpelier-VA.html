<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
