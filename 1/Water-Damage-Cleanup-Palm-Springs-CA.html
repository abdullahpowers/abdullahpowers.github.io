<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most terrible things that can occur to a household or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being completely changed.

However, if the damage is major then the whole floor might need changing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The sort of wood floor covering you may have figures out and limits the type of repairs that require to occur. Strong hardwood flooring enables a larger series of choices to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area.
