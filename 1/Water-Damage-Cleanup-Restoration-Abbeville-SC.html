How quickly the corrosion process takes depends on a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
