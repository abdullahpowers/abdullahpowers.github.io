Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of remedying drywall water damage is to prevent additional damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew take place most regularly.

Standard home fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air needed to dry a room effectively.</p>
