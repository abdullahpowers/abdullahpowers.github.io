<p>Vapor pressure is directly related to humidity ratio (specific humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is used to a material, energy is added. Raising the temperature of a wet material increases the rate of evaporation, further launching wetness from the material and changing the internal vapor pressure. The greater the distinction between ambient temperature and humidity temperature level, the greater the capacity for faster and more effective drying.</p>
<p>Smoke damage can create chaos in your home. Kitchen area flare-ups, closed fireplace flues, and electrical fires can send smoke throughout your home, charring walls, covering everything, and stinking up the place.

So get to work, but not without gloves, eye defense, a facemask, and a respirator to keep smoke particles off your skin and out of your lungs.</p>
