Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
