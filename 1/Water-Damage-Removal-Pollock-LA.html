<p>You wish to deal with restroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
