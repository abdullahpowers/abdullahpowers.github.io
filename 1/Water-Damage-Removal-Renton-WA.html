Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at removing mold than a moderate detergent and a damp cloth, so we advise the least harmful choice.</p>
<p>Many mold infestations start little, and might go undetected if they are inside a crawl area, duct, or other inconspicuous area. For that reason, your first indication of a mold infestation may be a musty smell. Other signs consist of staining on the walls or ceilings and visible mold development on walls and other surfaces.
