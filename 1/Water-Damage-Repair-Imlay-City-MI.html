<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
