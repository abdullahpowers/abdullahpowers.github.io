<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is among the most destructive things that can take place to a family or an individual. When your home is damaged by water, you want to clean it quickly and make sure it doesn't happen again. After all, your home is your safe haven, you do not want it infected by pollutants, mold, and germs from flood water.

Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
