<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling because of a leaky roofing, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you stress and anxiety and aggravation, particularly if you've never ever done it before. Mold needs simply three things to make it through and grow: humidity, darkness and wetness. The most common areas in your home for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, carpets, ducts and crawlspaces. The best method to prevent mold growth is to get rid of water leaks or moisture in your home. See our short article, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold prevention suggestions.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
