<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet.
