<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most devastating things that can occur to an individual or a household. To begin addressing a water damaged wall or ceiling in your home, you need to recognize the source of the water. It is possible for water to take a trip far from the website of the leak and cause damage elsewhere, in unexpected areas.

<p>Water damage arises from damaged pipes, obstructed drains, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends upon the nature of the damage.
