While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
