<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They fasted to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (often two times a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the method and likewise were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we first look for any security dangers, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for restricted area entry.

We will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them if they have actually been damaged.</p>
