<p>Completely shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating service, then spray the afflicted area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly during this process in order to guarantee the option stays well blended.) Enable the liquid to sit on the mold for 5 to 10 minutes so the anti-bacterial homes have time to work through the gunk. Never scrape dried mold, or else the harmful spores could spread out into air and cause negative health effects.</p>
<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke stains. This stage is essential, as these sponges use unique chemicals to raise spots from walls. Never ever utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces underneath. Or just get a brand-new sponge. Make certain you utilize a wiping motion the whole time. You might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the stains.</p>
