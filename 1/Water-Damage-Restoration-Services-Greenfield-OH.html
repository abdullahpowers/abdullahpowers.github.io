<p>Because it's difficult to eliminate mold in your house entirely, it is necessary to keep your air clear by frequently replacing air filters. Think about using High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or bigger (mold is typically 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from flowing. You may also think about an air purifier that will remove mold spores. If you live in an especially damp environment, find one with an antimicrobial filter to make sure that the filter itself remains free from mold.</p>
<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
