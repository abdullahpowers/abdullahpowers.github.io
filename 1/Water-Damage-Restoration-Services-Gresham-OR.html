<p>During a flood cleanup, the indoor air quality in your house or office might appear to be the least of your problems. However, failure to eliminate contaminated products and to reduce wetness and humidity can present major long-lasting health risks.

They can trigger disease, trigger allergic reactions, and continue to damage products long after the flood.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
