<p>The equipment we use can running for days without being switched off (it will not get too hot), and unless we recommend you otherwise, it is best to leave it on and performing at all times until the job is completed.

<p>When standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments.</p>
