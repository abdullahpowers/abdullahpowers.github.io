<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered how much water bill I was paying because the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and really courteous person.</p>
