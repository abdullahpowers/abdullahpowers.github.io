<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most devastating things that can occur to a person or a family. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being totally replaced. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need fixing. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the entire floor might need replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The sort of wood flooring you might have restricts the type and figures out of repairs that need to happen.

With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This type of floor covering can likewise have replacements for individual planks.
