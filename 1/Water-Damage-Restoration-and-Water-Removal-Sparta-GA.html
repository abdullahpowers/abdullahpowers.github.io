<p>Because typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
