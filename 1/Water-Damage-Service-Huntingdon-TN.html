<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
