<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most efficient. It is imperative to figure out if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and hidden energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they respond to each one and provide the very best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
