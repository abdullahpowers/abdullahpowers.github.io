<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the space you're repairing so that you understand how much brand-new wallboard you require. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and after that secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power motorist. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel meets. Then use joint substance over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time specified by the producer and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper till the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
