<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to assess which drying devices or methods will be the most efficient. It is essential to identify if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and practical energy, can be determined by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they react to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
