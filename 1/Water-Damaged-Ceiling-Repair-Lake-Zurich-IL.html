<h2>Conquering Mold From Water Damage in Lake Zurich</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it wet can develop into a significant headache. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and just begins to sag before drying, fixing it may just require pushing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
