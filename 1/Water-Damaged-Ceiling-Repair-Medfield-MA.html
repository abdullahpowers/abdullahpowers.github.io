<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>After you discover how to eliminate mold, concentrate on preventing it in the future. Controlling wetness is the essential to stopping most mold. The worst infestations normally occur in wet crawl spaces, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outdoors, and in basements with poor foundation drainage. Stopping leakages, guaranteeing great ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water away from the structure are the best defenses against mold.</p>
