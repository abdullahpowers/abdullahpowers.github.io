When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really costly paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
