<p>Because typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
