It's an unfortunate fact that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Probably the most typical is the smashed screen, which we discuss in our article on getting a broken iPhone repaired However the 2nd most common is water damage.

<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
