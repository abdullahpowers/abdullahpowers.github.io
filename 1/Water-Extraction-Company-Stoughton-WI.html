<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that wipe it away with a wet towel. Similar to some of the above techniques, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>

Often avoidance gets neglected throughout the rush to eliminate a problem that already exists, however we believe preventative procedures can offer lasting security. Our remediation procedure includes avoidance of future development for these reasons.
