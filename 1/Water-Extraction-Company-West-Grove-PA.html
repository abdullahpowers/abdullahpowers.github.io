<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
