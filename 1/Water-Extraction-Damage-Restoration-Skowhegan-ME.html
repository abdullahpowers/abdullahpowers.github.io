Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors.

While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne.
