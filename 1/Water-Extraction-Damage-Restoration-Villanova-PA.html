Toll's vice president of construction, Anthony Geonnotti, for example, testified in 2017 that, within slightly more than two years, he had checked 300 to 350 houses in the region for water invasion-- with roughly 85 percent needing repairs, according to an arbitration hearing transcript filed in court. Countless homeowners have found the issues only after it's too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing out on the due date by just weeks or months.</p>

We will likewise check vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and remove them if they have actually been damaged.</p>
