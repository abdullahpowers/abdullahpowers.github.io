<p>Vapor pressure is straight related to humidity ratio (specific humidity or grains per pound-gpp and humidity). As heat is used to a material, energy is included. Raising the temperature level of a wet product increases the rate of evaporation, further releasing moisture from the product and changing the internal vapor pressure. The higher the distinction between ambient temperature level and dew point temperature, the higher the potential for faster and more effective drying.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up. When damp inbound air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This procedure absorbs moisture without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily operate below freezing temperature levels.</p>
