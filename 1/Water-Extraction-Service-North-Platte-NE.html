These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This procedure goes on for days.
