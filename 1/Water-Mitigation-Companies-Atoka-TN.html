The type of wood floor covering you may have limits the type and figures out of repairs that require to occur. Solid hardwood flooring permits a larger variety of choices to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area.
