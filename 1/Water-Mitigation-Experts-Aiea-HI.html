If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>
