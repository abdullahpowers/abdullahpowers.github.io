<p>You want to address restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and agitate the moistened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Do not attempt or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, drapes or other household fabric items. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the material, making cleaning harder. Use a dry, absorbent fabric to clean down the phone. Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent cloth. Make certain to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume secrets, the headphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
