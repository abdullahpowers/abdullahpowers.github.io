<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your home and began drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the method and also were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>

Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location.

<p>Examination reports and claims by 7 next-door neighbors on the block now allege that building and construction defects allowed water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test showed that some parts of their wall had likely decomposed and developed mold.
