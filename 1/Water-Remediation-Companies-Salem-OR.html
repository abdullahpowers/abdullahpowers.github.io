Computing the dew point is essential in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas kind. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid type if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the dew point rises, the greater the quantity of wetness in the air.</p>
