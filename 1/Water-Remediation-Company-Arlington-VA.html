<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were very valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially check for any security dangers, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for confined space entry. We then extract standing water using our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has actually been impacted, we will get rid of the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely deal with it. We will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have been damaged.</p>
