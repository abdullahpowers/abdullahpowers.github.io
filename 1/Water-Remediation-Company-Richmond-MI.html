<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.<p>
