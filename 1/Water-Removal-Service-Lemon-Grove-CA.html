<h3>Fire And Restoration in Lemon Grove</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, bear in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is finished.<p>
