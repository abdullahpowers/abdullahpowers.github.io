Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very courteous individual.</p>
