Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Rapid air movement across the surface area of product ends up being lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness gives way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products need different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
