<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Try to find noticeable mold development (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find signs of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical. When blended with ammonia, chlorine bleach likewise offers off harsh fumes and it even produces poisonous gas.
