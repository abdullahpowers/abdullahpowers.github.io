<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
