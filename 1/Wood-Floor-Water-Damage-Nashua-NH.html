<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to keep the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can acquire devices to determine relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of moisture in the home are all really essential in controlling high humidity that regularly causes mold development in our environment.</p>
