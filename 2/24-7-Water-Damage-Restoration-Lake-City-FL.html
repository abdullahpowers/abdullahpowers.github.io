Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve.
