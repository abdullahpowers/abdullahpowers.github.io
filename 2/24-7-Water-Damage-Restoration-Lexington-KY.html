Once MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working.

If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
