<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.

<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Hazelwood</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
