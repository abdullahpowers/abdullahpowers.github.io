<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache because the gypsum drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply starts to sag prior to drying out, repairing it may just require pressing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
