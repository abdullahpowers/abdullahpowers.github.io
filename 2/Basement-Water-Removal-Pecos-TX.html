A fireplace can provide your living room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and broke chimney can typically let in rain throughout the colder months which can leak through the walls. Gradually, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to bubble, peel and flake. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and worn out  space.<p>
