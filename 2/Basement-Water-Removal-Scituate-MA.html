The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying devices or methods will be the most effective. It is imperative to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in identifying what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and hidden energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building products and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
