<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This sort of dehumidifier removes water vapor from the air using a procedure called condensation. LGR dehumidifiers continue to remove a considerable quantity of water vapor listed below 40 grains per pound.

LGR dehumidifiers utilize a double cooling or enhanced action to decrease the moisture-laden air temperature when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
