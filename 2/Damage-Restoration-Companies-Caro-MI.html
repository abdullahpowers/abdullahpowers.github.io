<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and steady wear and tear of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you combine electrical power, metal, water and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more frequently known as rust). There is no dependable schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal parts usually start wearing away right away after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can operate generally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How quick the rust process takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can resolve the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
