<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
