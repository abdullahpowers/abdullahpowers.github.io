Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired instead of being completely changed. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might require fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor may need replacing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood flooring you might have identifies and limits the type of repair work that require to happen. Strong hardwood flooring permits a larger range of choices to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This type of flooring can also have replacements for individual slabs.
