<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Given that tiny mold spores exist naturally almost all over, inside and outdoors, eliminating all mold from a home or organisation is difficult.

Think about utilizing High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are developed to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is generally 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from flowing. You might likewise consider an air cleanser that will remove mold spores. If you live in a particularly damp environment, discover one with an antimicrobial filter to ensure that the filter itself stays free from mold.</p>
