Stone floors require less time to change than water damaged hardwood floors. A complete floor replacement can be anticipated to be finished in 4 to 10 days. Water damaged walls often peel and might require both repair and repainting; the latter service needs a number of hours.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done appropriately. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
