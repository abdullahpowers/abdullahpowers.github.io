This process soaks up wetness without ice build-up and is not restricted by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily operate below freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Examination reports and lawsuits by 7 next-door neighbors on the block now allege that building problems allowed water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test revealed that some parts of their wall had actually likely decomposed and developed mold. Paper meant to line the roof, rather than the kind needed by the building code, was utilized on the walls.
