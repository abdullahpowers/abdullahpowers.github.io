<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
