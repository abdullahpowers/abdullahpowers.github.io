<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>After the water and moisture have actually been eliminated the next step to repair water damage is to clean and sanitize the affected areas. Flood water typically brings sewage and other pollutants with it. These contaminants must be eliminated before final repairs are conducted. Industrial sanitizers and commercial cleaners will make sure that your residential or commercial property is successfully cleaned and treated.</p>
