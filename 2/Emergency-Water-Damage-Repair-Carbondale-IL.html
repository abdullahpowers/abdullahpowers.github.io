<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were extremely handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.
