<p>Since big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged locations larger than 12 square inches might need a total replacement panel set up. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For example, if the space where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes joists or studs where it will be possible to protect a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to replace the entire drywall panel.</p>
