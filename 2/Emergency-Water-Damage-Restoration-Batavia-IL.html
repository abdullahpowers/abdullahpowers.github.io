<p>Since big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas larger than 12 square inches may require a total replacement panel set up. It depends upon where the damage is located on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For instance, if the space where you eliminated the damaged drywall exposes joists or studs where it will be possible to protect a spot by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to replace the entire drywall panel.</p>
