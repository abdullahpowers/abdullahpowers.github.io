<p>When you are planning large repairs, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges.

When the job is finished, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
