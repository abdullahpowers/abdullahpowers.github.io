<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Search for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>After the water and moisture have actually been removed the next step to fix water damage is to clean and sanitize the impacted areas. Flood water typically brings sewage and other toxins with it.
