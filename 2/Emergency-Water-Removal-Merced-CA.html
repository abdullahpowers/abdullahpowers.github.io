<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>As moisture is launched in the air, nature constantly attempts to reach balance. Determining the dew point is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid type.
