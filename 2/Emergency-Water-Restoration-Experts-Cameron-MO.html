<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Even when you contain a small indoor fire, smoke damage can happen. That's due to the fact that fire is a visible combustion of light and heat, and the majority of people understand how to contain a fire. For that reason, individuals will work to include a fire without prioritizing smoke damage prevention. Smoke is a little harder to see than the fire itself and seems less threatening. Also, because it's in the air, it's nearly difficult to contain. Even after a fire is snuffed out, smoke in the air can trigger damage. Smoke damage restoration services are often needed to bring back damage left behind from little indoor fires.</p>

<p>Fixing damage must be the first step you require to get your home looking its finest. If a part of your house needs structural repair after a storm, a fire or water damage, get that fixed before doing any cosmetic work.
