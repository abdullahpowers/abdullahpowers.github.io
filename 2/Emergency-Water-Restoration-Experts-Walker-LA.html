<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at risk of mold growth. There is an excellent video listed below that I motivate you to see.

<h3>Emergency Water Damage in Walker Louisiana</h2>
<p>Mold can be found almost anywhere you turn. They grow on essentially any organic compound as long as wetness and oxygen are present. Mold can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation. When excessive moisture collects in your home or office mold development will typically take place, especially if the moisture issue stays undiscovered or unaddressed. It is difficult to get rid of all mold and mold spores, but it can be managed.</p>
<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly attempts to reach balance. Computing the dew point is very important in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid form. The greater the dew point increases, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
