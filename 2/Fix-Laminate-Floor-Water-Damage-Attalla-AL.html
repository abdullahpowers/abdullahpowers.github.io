If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and then secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel meets.
