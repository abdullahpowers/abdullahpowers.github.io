<p>The Epa (EPA) recommends discarding products that haven't been thoroughly cleaned and dried within 48 hours of water damage. Repair any leaks or underlying problems immediately to help prevent mold growth or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and beyond your home. For that reason, it is not possible to completely eliminate" all of the mold from within a structure, as microscopic spores will still exist even after the problem has been resolved.<p>

Insurance coverage typically pays if the problem results from an emergency currently covered on your policy, like a burst pipeline, but not if mold resulted from delayed maintenance, consistent moisture or seepage, or from floodwaters (unless you have flood insurance). If you experience water damage, it's important NOT to take a knee jerk reaction. It's finest to call your insurance company right away.
