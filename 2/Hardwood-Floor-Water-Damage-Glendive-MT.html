<p>Mold remediation is the procedure of seeking out and removing the mold within your home, while containing it and avoiding it from infecting other surface areas. Due to the fact that mold spores can become airborne and infected other wet areas, it is very important to have professional air screening and remediation done whenever you encounter mold in the home.
