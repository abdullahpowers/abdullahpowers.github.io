<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
