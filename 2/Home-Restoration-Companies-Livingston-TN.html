<p>BRAVO - task well done! Found a flood at home in San Francisco - water had actually been over flowing a 2nd floor sink for 15 hours.

Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood walls, floors and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Excellent, professional care.
