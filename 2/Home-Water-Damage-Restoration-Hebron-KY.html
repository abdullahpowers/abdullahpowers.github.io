<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his people were remarkable in assisting us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were extremely practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.
