<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many individuals swear by raw rice, advising owners to put their wet iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the things (cover it completely) and leave it there for 48 hours or so. A: Mold is a microscopic fungus that is part of the natural surroundings and necessary for our ecosystem. While it is necessary in the outdoor world, excessive mold inside a structure can be unsafe and unsanitary. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores float through the air both inside and outside.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed properly or the HEATING AND COOLING system isn't properly vented and serviced, ducts can also include a lot of mold growth due to moisture accumulation and condensation that can take place.
