<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling due to the fact that of a dripping roofing, condensation from your central air, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and stress, specifically if you've never done it in the past. Mold requires just three things to survive and grow: darkness, moisture and humidity. The most common areas in your house for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, ducts, crawlspaces and carpets. The best way to prevent mold growth is to get rid of water leakages or wetness in your house. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention pointers.</p>
<p>After the water and moisture have actually been eliminated the next action to repair water damage is to clean and sterilize the affected locations.
