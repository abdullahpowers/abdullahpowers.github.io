<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may collapse or droop under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you may notice small signs like coffee-colored spots that may broaden with time.</p>
<p>At SERVPRO of Gwinnett County South, we are water removal and clean-up professionals.

<h3>Water Damage Companies Near Me in Whitney Texas</h2>
<p>Knowing how to identify exactly what is damp throughout a water loss is an important part of the job. Molds and germs can grow if locations of moisture are ignored. To protect your property and health, all of the excess wetness should be found and eliminated. Along with wetness sensing units, Bales service technicians use infrared technology that is capable of reading" masonry, wood and wallboard to discover concealed moisture that is often hard to detect.</p>
<p>Mold is a fungi that can be found both inside your home and outdoors. No one understands how many species of mold exist but estimates range from tens of thousands to possibly 3 hundred thousand or more. Mold spreads and replicates by making spores. Spores can endure conditions that are too bright, hot, cold, dry or damp for mold to grow. They can be brought by air or water to new locations when spores are released.</p>
<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some products, when exposed to water for a period of time, end up being completely damaged (i.e. they will never ever be the same). Other items may simply need to be disinfected and transferred to high ground. Soft items like clothing, bedspreads, drapes can be sent to a laundry service that we can arrange for you. Another point is, there are different levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), and that will factor into the formula of what can be conserved and what must be replaced. We will deal with you throughout the loss, setting aside products that we feel can not be successfully restored so you can make a list to develop into your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then identify a compensation for your items according to the terms of your policy.</p>
