<p>You wish to deal with restroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
