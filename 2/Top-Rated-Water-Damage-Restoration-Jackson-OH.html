<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most destructive things that can take place to an individual or a family.

The type of wood flooring you might have identifies and restricts the type of repair work that need to happen. Strong hardwood flooring allows for a broader range of choices to fix the issue. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface.

Should you send a claim for mold damage, this cause would be examined and determined by the flood insurance coverage adjuster.</p>
