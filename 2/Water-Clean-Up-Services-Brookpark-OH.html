<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is wet and good, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Because the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water, getting it wet can develop into a significant headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply starts to droop before drying out, fixing it may simply require pressing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
