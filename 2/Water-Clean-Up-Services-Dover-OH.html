<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable signs of moisture, dripping water, or indications of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might droop or fall apart under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum product. Other times, you might notice little signs like coffee-colored spots that might expand with time.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
