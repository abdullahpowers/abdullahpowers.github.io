<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that is present in the environment and a source of combustible fuel. As soon as this flammable fuel - drywall, carpet, or furniture - has actually been heated up to its special ignition temperature, the fuel will catch fire and unpredictable gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger lasting damage and must be handled by skilled experts, heat is the most obvious, and damaging, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire comes into contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
