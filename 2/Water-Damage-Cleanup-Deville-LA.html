We understand precisely what you are experiencing as we also have conquered water damage from a flooded basement in our home. Our experience has changed our lives forever. Our houses are our safe location. Home is where we raise our families, get together for vacations, and where we unwind, relax, and locked out the busyness of daily life. When water intruded in our home we chose to fight back and it became our mission to help other families through the process and aftermath of water damage. In 2014 we opened SERVPRO of West Sioux Falls to perform that mission and respond to the questions of the unknown.</p>
<p>The best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the presence of a mold problem needing action and the degree of damage then writes a clear scope of work including relevant standards.

Without a clear contract in composing the conclusions, data, measurements are left to the interpretation of each party.</p>
