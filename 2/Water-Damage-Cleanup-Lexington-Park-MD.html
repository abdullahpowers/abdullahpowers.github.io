<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>An insurance plan may or might not cover the costs related to water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a common reason for residential water damage is typically the failure of a sump pump, numerous homeowner's insurance plan do not cover the associated costs without an addendum which contributes to the month-to-month premium of the policy. Frequently the terminology of this addendum is similar to "Sewer and Drain Coverage".</p>
