<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
