<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a family or company can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
