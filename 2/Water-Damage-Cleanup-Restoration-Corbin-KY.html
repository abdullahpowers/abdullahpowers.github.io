<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some artificial products such as paints and adhesives. Mold requires wetness, although some mold types can obtain that moisture from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can check sheetrock at floor level. The porous material can rapidly absorb flood water, and you need to know the degree of potential damage.<p>
