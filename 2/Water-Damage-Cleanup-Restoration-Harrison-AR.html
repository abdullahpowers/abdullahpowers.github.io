Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying since the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
