After a heavy rain storm, a fast response is CRITICAL to reducing prospective secondary damages and costs to your Portland home or company.

<p>At this phase in the fire damage restoration procedure, the professionals get rid of the remaining smoke, dust, and particles and soot residue from items and surfaces, and the residential or commercial property will be sterilized. Clean floors, cabinets and any other surfaces affected by bathroom flood waters. Round off the job with a disinfectant designed to prevent mold development. Class 4 damage requires specialized drying due to damage done to materials such as stone, hardwood, and concrete.<p>
