When you have water damage and aren't sure right away from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or broken pipelines can be a significant headache.

<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete).

Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
