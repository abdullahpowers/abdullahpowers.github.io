<p>Beginning water damage cleanup as quickly as possible is important since water can be absorbed by porous products, including wood and sheetrock, or seep under the substructure of floorings. First, we eliminate excess water, and then continue water damage remediation with professional dehumidifying and drying to avoid mold development. Plus, we use water detection probes to discover concealed water damage cleanup problems that could result in mold growth, rusted pipelines or other concerns. Our complete series of water damage remediation services includes repair or replacement of structural components such as decayed wood or ruined drywall, and cleaning or security of individual contents or decorative products.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep photos of the water damage and all files related to the damage and your claim in case mold grows in the future. Your insurance company might be hesitant to agree that any prospective mold is the result of prior water damage, but having images and records will serve as valuable evidence of your claim. If the mold is considered to have originated from water damage, some insurers may make you submit a 2nd claim of water damage instead, needing you to pay another deductible before remediation occurs.</p>
