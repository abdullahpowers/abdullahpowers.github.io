They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.
