<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
