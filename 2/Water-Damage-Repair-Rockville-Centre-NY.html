<p>Mold Removal. Structure materials and personal belongings in your house can be affected. Considering that mold is a living organism and deeply ingrains itself into products to survive, it is best to dispose of anything porous.

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the home with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one unit for every two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
