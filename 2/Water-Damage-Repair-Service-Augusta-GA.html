<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
