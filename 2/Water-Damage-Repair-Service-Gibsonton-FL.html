<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, however it can happen on its own if a fire is contained. Without appropriate cleaning, smoke odor stays in clothes, linens, drapes, pillows, clothes and other soft" items for months or longer.

<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Gibsonton</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and ought to be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
