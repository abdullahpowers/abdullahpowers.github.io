Tough surface areas that are affected need to be cleaned and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpets, rug, plaster wallboard must be eliminated and properly dealt with. Any material that takes in considerable quantities of wetness and can not be properly cleaned ought to be eliminated. Once polluted products have been gotten rid of, a 2nd application of sanitizers should be used to all work surfaces.</p>
