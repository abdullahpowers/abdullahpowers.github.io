<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Try to find noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, velvety, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>If you've just experienced a water occasion, you may be questioning what to do next: Seeping water damage is progressive, prevalent and can indicate important things may end up being permanently damaged - especially if emergency action is postponed beyond the very first 48 hours. When moisture leaks into products of value there are instant actions that can be required to minimize the quantity of long-term damage that results.</p>

Research studies have actually revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at killing air-borne mold or surface mold contamination.

Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise the use of ozone to address mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>

<p>Examine the drywall to see just how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to remove it. If drywall panels just reveal water spots but aren't structurally compromised, they may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion.
