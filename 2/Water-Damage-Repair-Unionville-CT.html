<h3>Drywall Water Damage Repair in Unionville Connecticut</h2>
<p>When a client calls with a water damage emergency, our team is prepared to respond immediately. Immediate water extraction and drying is needed to include the extent of the water damage and not run the risk of more damage. If water sits too long, mold becomes a significant danger. The longer a water damage scenario is left unresolved, the more damage takes place and the problem will become more pricey to repair.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes.</p>
