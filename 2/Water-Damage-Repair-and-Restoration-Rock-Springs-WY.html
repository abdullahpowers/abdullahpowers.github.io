<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings should be consisted of in the drying record to include air, hvac, and devices systems. Wetness content levels for wet structural materials should be taped in a moisture material spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These recorded wetness material readings will reveal that the building is back to an acceptable range of pre-loss condition. It is necessary to understand that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if adequate dehumidification is being utilized or if changes are required.</p>
