<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Eastlake</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts usually recommend is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush till the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water easily.
