<h3>Basement Water Damage Restoration in Madison Wisconsin</h2>
<p>The effects of insufficient home water damage restoration are far too great to leave flood damage cleanup improperly restored. A lot of property owners are not familiar with what is needed to complete water damage repair and have a lot of questions. That's where the qualified water removal experts like us come in. Our water damage restoration specialists are certified through formal training and experience on water extraction and how to remove excess flood water completely, to make certain evaporation happens and to develop the dehumidification required to stop more damage.</p>
<p>Water damage is one of the primary causes of mold growing on the walls and ceilings of a house. Any sign of excessive wetness, musty smells or mold need to be tackled as quickly as possible to avoid further complications that may cause health issues and severe damage to the house. Mold assessments are typically useful to detect any kind of mold growing in your home, particularly those that might affect your health adversely.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Hydrogen peroxide is an excellent alternative to chlorine bleach due to the fact that it is safe to use and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave behind harmful residue or produce poisonous fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can purchase hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
