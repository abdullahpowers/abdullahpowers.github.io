<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Given that tiny mold spores exist naturally practically everywhere, inside and outdoors, removing all mold from a home or service is impossible. Numerous restoration organisations promote mold removal" and even guarantee to eliminate all mold. This is a misconception. We understand mold and mold development.
