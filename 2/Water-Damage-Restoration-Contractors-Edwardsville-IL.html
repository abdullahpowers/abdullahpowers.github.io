<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show noticeable signs of wetness, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or collapse under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster product. Other times, you might discover little indications like coffee-colored spots that may broaden gradually.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache because the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and just starts to droop before drying, repairing it may just require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
