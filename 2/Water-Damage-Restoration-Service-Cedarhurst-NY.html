For soft, washable products, such as clothing and bedding, first decide if the product deserves keeping. Smoke is challenging to fully get rid of, and you might have more crucial things to hang out on. Multiple wash cycles - without letting the products dry in between - might be required. We'll look after every detail when it concerns fire and smoke restoration, including the removal of soot, smell, debris, hazardous toxic substances, water, and fixing structural damage.<p>
