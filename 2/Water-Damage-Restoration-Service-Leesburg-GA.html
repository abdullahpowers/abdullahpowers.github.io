<p>Since it's difficult to eliminate mold in the house entirely, it is necessary to keep your air clear by routinely replacing air filters. Think about using High Effectiveness Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is typically 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from flowing.
