If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and must be eliminated.

<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By reducing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is completed.<p>
