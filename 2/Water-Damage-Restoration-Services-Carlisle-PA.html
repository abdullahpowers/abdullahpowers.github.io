Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
