<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

But contrary to the popular view, it isn't. Bleach is a strong chemical which can hurt your health. Likewise, it does not eliminate the mold. It just changes its color from black to grey or white.
