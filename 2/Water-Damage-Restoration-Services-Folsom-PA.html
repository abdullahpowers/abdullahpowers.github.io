A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of warmth and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can typically allow rain throughout the chillier months which can permeate through the walls. With time, moisture from the water can cause the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a exhausted and unloved space.<p>
<p>In more advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: significant leak or radiant floor heating leakage), repairing the subfloor might even be essential.
