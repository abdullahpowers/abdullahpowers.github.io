<p>You want to deal with bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to lift and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
