<p>Finally, we wish to attend to the use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical level of sensitivities especially if utilized in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at eliminating mold than a moderate detergent and a wet cloth, so we advise the least poisonous option.</p>
<p>A good way to prevent mold from growing in your home is to lower humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, inspect your home for leakages. Mop it up quickly and dry the area if water does enter your home. Likewise, try to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not raining, of course) or putting fans in your space. And keep your indoor humidity listed below 60%.</p>
