<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
