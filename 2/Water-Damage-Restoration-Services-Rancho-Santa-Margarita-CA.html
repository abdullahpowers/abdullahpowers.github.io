<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a wet towel. Just like a few of the above techniques, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working all right. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's utilized on as it is a severe, destructive chemical.

There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce unsafe fumes or leave behind hazardous residue. For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you need to use it, only use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
