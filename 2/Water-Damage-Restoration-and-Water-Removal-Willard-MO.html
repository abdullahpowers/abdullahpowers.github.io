<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts typically advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products soak up water easily. This could intensify the problem due to the fact that as you understand - mold likes damp environments.<p>
