<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As discussed, quick air movement throughout wet surfaces of products or assemblies is a vital component of efficiently and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials.

The constant and falling rates of drying products need different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
