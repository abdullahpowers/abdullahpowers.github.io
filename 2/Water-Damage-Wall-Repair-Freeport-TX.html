<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely destructive. We engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was produced. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged specialist on the biological elements of air pollution, this team was assigned to confirm and evaluate the new technology.

Together, we were able to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for business consumers that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can deliver scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to assist make sure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
