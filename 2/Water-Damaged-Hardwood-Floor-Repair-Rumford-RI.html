<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape.

As soon as the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
