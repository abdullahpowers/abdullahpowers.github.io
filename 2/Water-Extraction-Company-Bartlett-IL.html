They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job properly.
