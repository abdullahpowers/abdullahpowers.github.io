<p>Since the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it damp can turn into a significant headache. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to droop before drying out, fixing it might simply require pressing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
