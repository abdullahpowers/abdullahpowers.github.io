<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Even as builders have actually combated claims, nearly two dozen homeowners said that they were never ever informed of any potential problem-- even as some building executives knew of its extent. Toll's vice president of building, Anthony Geonnotti, for example, affirmed in 2017 that, within somewhat more than two years, he had actually examined 300 to 350 homes in the region for water invasion-- with approximately 85 percent needing repairs, according to an arbitration hearing records submitted in court. Numerous homeowners have actually discovered the problems only after it's far too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing out on the deadline by simply weeks or months.</p>
