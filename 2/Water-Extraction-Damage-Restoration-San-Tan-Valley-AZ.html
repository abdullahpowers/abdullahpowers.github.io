<p>Cleanup: Throughout the cleaning and restoration phase of the task, your experienced cleanup team will use the proper mix of cleaning representatives, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers. Using chem-sponges is crucial in this stage. A chem-sponge gathers soot and particles when it comes into contact with them. It also avoids spotting on walls and surface areas. Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned are first cleaned with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and ventilating representative. These multiple actions are needed to ensure ceilings and walls are clean and that residual odor has actually been eliminated.</p>
