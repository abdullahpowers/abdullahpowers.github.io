<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As discussed, fast air movement across wet surfaces of materials or assemblies is an important element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Rapid air movement across the surface area of material ends up being lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface wetness gives way to lowering moisture material in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials require various criteria for changing conditions.</p>
<p>The most crucial aspect of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most frequently when damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation.

Basic household fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air needed to dry a space adequately.</p>
