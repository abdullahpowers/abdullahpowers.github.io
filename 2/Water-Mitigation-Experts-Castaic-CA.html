Depending on the seriousness of the damage, this procedure may draw from one day to several.<p>
<p>11. Drywall and other kinds of wall products normally don't dry extremely well, so if your walls are soaked, it's usually best to rip them out to prevent mold, specifically if they aren't absolutely dry within 48 hours. Like bleach, ammonia will kill mold on tough non-porous surfaces such as counter tops, glass or tiles but it is ineffective at killing mold growing in permeable product such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>Not everyone is sensitive to mold, and there are some molds that are black in color, but not excessively damaging. Speak with a mold remediation professional about what type of mold you have and what the level of colonization is. Sorry, we are just supplying mobile phone parts, not a service center.
