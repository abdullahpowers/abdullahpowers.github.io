Vinyl floor covering and floor tile might need to be removed to permit drying of subfloor.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in North Adams</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush until the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This might exacerbate the issue because as you know - mold likes moist environments.<p>
