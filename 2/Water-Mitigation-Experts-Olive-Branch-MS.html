Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
