<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (often twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
