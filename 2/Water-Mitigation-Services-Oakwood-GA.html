<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Oakwood</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health danger and should be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
