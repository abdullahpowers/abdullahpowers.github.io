<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

Frequently the verbiage of this addendum resembles "Sewer and Drain Coverage".</p>
