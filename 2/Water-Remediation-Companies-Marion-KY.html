<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
