<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Portage</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health threat and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
