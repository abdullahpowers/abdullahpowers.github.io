<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>The most essential element of correcting drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When wet drywall sits with insufficient ventilation, mold and mildew happen most regularly.

Basic home fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate amount of air required to dry a space sufficiently.</p>

<p>The area that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily travel as soon as they are disrupted. Air filtering systems are usually used in combination with the sealing of the area to remove as numerous air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area includes the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative atmospheric pressure, which avoids the flow of air between the contaminated area and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be shut off to prevent the mold from spreading as well.</p>

Please also beware that there are different sort of testers ranging from home inspectors to commercial hygienists. Please ask your independent tester if their tests, in writing, will stand in court.</p>
