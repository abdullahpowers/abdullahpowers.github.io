<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
