Fabrics might be cleaned, for instance, but anything the mold and wetness might have completely stained or damaged, such as drywall 3, insulation, or carpeting may need to be eliminated. Expenses begin at $2,000 for cleaning materials, but can reach $10,000 for getting rid of and changing drywall 3 and carpeting.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we first look for any safety threats, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted area entry. We then draw out standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has actually been affected, we will eliminate the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely dispose of it. If they have been damaged, we will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finishing that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and remove them.</p>
