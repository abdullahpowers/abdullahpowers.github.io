<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
