Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air contamination, this team was appointed to confirm and evaluate the new innovation.

Together, we had the ability to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for business consumers that, unlike any other technique or device, can deliver clinically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly.
