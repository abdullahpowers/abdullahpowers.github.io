<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Before your home has dried out, scrub floorings and woodwork with a stiff brush, plenty of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by contaminated floodwater must be gotten rid of and disposed of unless it can be sterilized at a commercial facility for a cost significantly less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile may need to be removed to permit drying of subfloor.</p>
