Constantly ensure the interior of the wall is dry prior to you seal it, or mold and mildew might become an issue later.<p>
<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers choose paper tape.
