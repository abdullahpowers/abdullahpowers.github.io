<h3>Fire And Restoration in Vincennes</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and must be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
